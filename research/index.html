    						<p align="justify">Accurate forecasting of labor productivity is key to enabling proactive project controls. Prior research has focused on forecasting weekly labor productivity trends using auto-regression (AR) models, modeling work-packages individually. Results are often limited to one-step-ahead forecasts, with models unable to automatically account for the factors that impact productivity.</p> 

							<p align="justify">This paper presents a case study on the implementation of a hybrid method based on AR and deep neural networks for time-series multi-step forecasting of daily labor productivity at the activity level. We demonstrate the forecasting capabilities of the model, which automatically accounts for the impact of factors on labor productivity trends.</p>

    						<p align="justify">In this paper, we present a novel hybrid method based on Auto-Regression (AR) and deep neural networks for time-series modeling of short-term labor productivity at the construction project level. Prior research on productivity forecasting had focused on AR models fitted with least-squares method. These classic AR methods are easily interpretable but they are slow to fit to the large volume of productivity data captured on jobsites. Also, specific assumptions are made on how resources or project constraints influence productivity rates and at best, these models can accurately predict one step ahead-of-time. Deep neural networks show promise in solving the scaleability problem; However, they can be complex for typical time-series data. They also lack interpretability which is key for labor productivity and root-cause analysis.</p> 

							<p align="justify">To bridge the gap between conventional AR methods and deep learning, we present ARRC-Net: Auto-Regression Resource-Constrained Network using a feed-forward neural network approach.  Using real-world productivity data from three construction projects, we demonstrate that the ARRC-Net: (1) automatically learns sparse AR-coefficients while making it interpretable similar to classic AR methods; (2) has a linear computational complexity compared to conventional AR methods which are quadratic; (3) scales well to forecasting productivity at multiple steps ahead of time, making it ideal for look-ahead planning purposes; (4) eliminates the need for making explicit assumptions about the influence of project constraints on productivity.</p>
							
							<p align="justify">The presented ARRC-Net predicts short-term productivity at both work-location and trade-level, continually and proactively.</p>
